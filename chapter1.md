# Supervised Learning

This section will cover Supervised Learning, which regroups machine learning techniques used with **labeled data**, i.e, for each example in the **training set**, we have the desired output \(**label**\).

A supervised learning algorithm is able to analyse the training data and to produce an inferred function, which is able to map new examples. These kind of algorithms can solve two problems:

* **Classification** problems, which consist in finding to which category a new example belongs. One common example is digit classification, i.e telling if a digit is a zero, a one, etc...
* **Regression** problem, which estimate the relationship between the data attributes in order to predict a continuous value. One example is house prices prediction using different features \(number of bedrooms, kitchen size ...\).
