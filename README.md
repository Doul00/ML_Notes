# ML\_Notes

I'm Abdoul-aziz AMADOU, a CS and Machine Learning student at [EPITA](http://www.epita.fr), which is an engineering school in Paris.

This book is a brief description of some Machine Learning Algorithms I learned about during my studies. I used different sources, either my class notes or internet ressources.
